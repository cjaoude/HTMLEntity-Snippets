Blaze through the most common HTML entities without giving them a second thought. The syntax is simple: a colon ‘:’ followed by the first character or two of the entity name.

## entity fractions
Create any *fraction* entity by altering the last two digits of `&frac12;`. The last two digits are a snippet placeholder, you can quickly tab-edit the numbers.

*fractions example*

Using `:12` yields `&frac12;` which is &frac12; .  If you then change it to `&frac14;` it will yield &frac14; .
